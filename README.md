# Tic-Tac-Toe with YOLOv8 and MyCobot Robotic Arm

## Project Overview
This project integrates the cutting-edge YOLOv8 object detection with a tactile Tic-Tac-Toe gaming experience, utilizing the MyCobot robotic arm. Our goal was to create a dynamic and interactive gaming environment where a computer-controlled robotic arm competes against a human player in Tic-Tac-Toe. The system is designed to identify game elements in real-time with high accuracy and respond with strategically executed moves.

## Key Features
- **Advanced Object Detection**: Utilizes YOLOv8 for real-time classification of Tic-Tac-Toe game elements with over 90% accuracy under various environmental conditions.
- **Robotic Precision**: The MyCobot robotic arm is programmed for precise and responsive movements, enhancing the tactile aspect of the gaming experience.
- **Strategic Gameplay**: Employs the minimax algorithm to make strategic decisions for the computer-controlled player.
- **Human-Computer Interaction**: The project emphasizes seamless interaction between the user and the computer, facilitated by a harmonious blend of computer vision and robotic control.

## Potential Applications
- **Educational Tools**: Can be used as an interactive tool to demonstrate the principles of robotics, AI, and computer vision.
- **Entertainment**: Offers a novel and engaging gaming experience.
- **Human-Robot Collaboration**: Demonstrates the potential for collaborative scenarios between humans and robots in various settings.

## System Requirements
